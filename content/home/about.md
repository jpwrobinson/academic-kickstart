# Biography

I'm a Senior Research Associate at Lancaster Environment Centre. My work aims to understand how climate change impacts coral reefs and small-scale fisheries, with a particular focus on Seychelles. I'm a quantitative ecologist, and I'm motivated to use statistical models to uncover ecological patterns from large temporal and spatial observational datasets. I'm also an advocate for open science approaches to research, and you can find all of my R code, statistical models, and published papers through this website.
