Relationships between abundance – body size and trophic position – body size can reveal size structuring in food webs and test ecological theory. Although there is considerable evidence of size structuring in temperate aquatic food webs, little is known about the structure of tropical coral reef food webs. Here, we use underwater visual-census data and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to test if coral reef fish communities (i) are size structured and (ii) follow metabolic scaling rules. After examining individuals from over 160 species spanning four orders of magnitude in body size, we show that abundance scaled negatively with body size and, as predicted, individuals sharing energy through predation (carnivorous fishes) scaled more steeply than those individuals sharing a common energy source (herbivorous fishes). Estimated size spectra were, however, shallower than predicted by metabolic theory. Trophic position scaled positively with body size across species and across individuals, providing novel evidence of size structuring in a diverse tropical food web. Size-based approaches hold great promise for integrating the complexities of food webs into simple quantitative measures, thus providing new insights into the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems.
