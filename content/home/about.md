I'm a Senior Research Associate at Lancaster Environment Centre in the UK. My work is focused on understanding climate change impacts on coral reefs and small-scale fisheries.  I use underwater datasets and fisheries surveys collected in the Indian Ocean to understand how mass bleaching events change fish communities and fishery productivity. Through these ecological pathways, my research explores how climate changes might impact food security and human health in the tropics.

As a macroecologist, I've been fortunate to work with lots of marine datasets from across the world - scuba surveys, fishery catches, satellite observations. Scientists and organisations who share these data are really important to my research, as are free tools such as R and Github. To promote that open science spirit, you can find links to my papers, figures and R code on this site.
