I'm a Senior Research Associate at Lancaster Environment Centre in the UK. My work is focused on understanding climate change impacts on coral reefs and small-scale fisheries. I am currently working in the Indian Ocean, using underwater datasets and fisheries surveys to examine the responses of Seychelles' reefs and fisheries to mass coral bleaching events.

As a macroecologist, I've been fortunate to work with lots of marine datasets from across the world - underwater scuba surveys, fisher's catches, satellite observations. Collaborators and governments who share these data are really important to my research, as are free tools such as R and Github. To promote that open science spirit, you can find published R code and statistical models on this site.
