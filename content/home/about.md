I'm a Senior Research Associate at Lancaster Environment Centre in the UK. My work is focused on understanding climate change impacts on coral reefs and small-scale fisheries. I am currently working in the Indian Ocean, using underwater datasets and fisheries surveys to examine long-term responses of Seychelles' reefs and fisheries after mass bleaching events.

As a macroecologist, I've been lucky enough to work with lots of observational datasets from across the world. Collaborators and governments who share these data really important to my research, as are free tools such as R and Github. To promote that open science spirit, you can find all of the R code and statistical models I've used in my papers through this website.
